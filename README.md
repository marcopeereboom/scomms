Secure Communications - One size, fits all crypto messaging tool.

Don't you hate that you need a different crypto tool for every single type of communication?
I do!

Scomms is built to address that.
A one size, fits all type tool for all encrypted communications.
From chat to messaging to VoIP and video conferencing; it should all be seamless and without a whole bunch of setup and installation requirements.

It reuses emails well known name @ domain to initiate communications.
Both parties must agree to communicate with each other before any messages are exchanged.

THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT TOOL THAT HAS NOT BEEN AUDITED YET!
USE WISELY.

Note: Currently only sending individual messages is supported.  I'll be adding the other forms of communication over time.
Also note that over time documentation on the tool and the algorithms will be added.
For now, the source is the documentation.
